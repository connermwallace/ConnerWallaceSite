            <h2>Scout</h2>
            <p>Scout is a tool designed to help with finding information about national parks near you. Simply enter
                your state and choose a category that interests you. Once this is done you will be greeted by several
                pins on the map for you to explore. Clicking on one and clicking on the name will show you more details
                about that place.
