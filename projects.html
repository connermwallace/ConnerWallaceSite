                <p>Bitewise is built off of layered API's to deliver immediate value to the user, with the use of pre-trained machine learning models specific to food that help identify the ingredients of any food from just a picture. Image bytecode data is first stored in Google Firebase, where the hosted url is then passed into Clarifai's food recognition API. The output of that is refined through Spoonacular's product data API asynchronously to offer specific product recommendations and reference prices which are dynamically summed according to selected products.
